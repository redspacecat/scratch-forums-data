This repository has the code that fetches new posts for Scratch Info's forum leaderboard rankings and post history. (https://scratchinfo.quuq.dev/forums)

The leaderboards have to be updated manually by me. I will try to do it every few days to weeks, but it might be a bit delayed.

The data you find on a user's post history page (https://scratchinfo.quuq.dev/users/Paddle2See/posts) updates about every six hours.
